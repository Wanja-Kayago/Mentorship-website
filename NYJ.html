  <p class="Summary">In the opening chapters of "Born a Crime," Trevor Noah throws us<br> into his childhood under Apartheid South Africa. <br>
    The humor present even in these dark realities is a testament to Noah's storytelling.<br> We see the absurdity of a system 
    that deems his very existence illegal due to his mixed race heritage.<br>

    These opening sections connect to many countries, including Kenya.<br> Both South Africa and Kenya have grappled with racial 
    segregation and its lasting effects. <br> In Kenya, colonial legacies and tribal tensions can create social divisions.<br>
     While Apartheid was a formal system, social prejudices can linger.<br>
    
    Noah's experience as a child navigating racial ambiguity resonates.  <br>Just as a mixed-race child challenged the racial order in South Africa,
    <br> children born from different ethnicities in Kenya can bridge cultural divides.<br>
