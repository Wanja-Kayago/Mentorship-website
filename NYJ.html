  <h1 class="tittle">A Summary Of Born a Crime Chapters 1 and 2</h1> 
  <p class="Summary">The opening chapters of Trevor Noah's "Born a Crime" introduce us to his childhood in Apartheid South Africa. 
    Noah, a child of a Black Xhosa mother and a white Swiss father, embodies the racial ambiguity that challenged the very foundation of this segregated society.
     His existence, humorously described despite the harsh reality, exposes the absurdity of laws that classified people based on race.

    These opening sections resonate deeply with Kenya, despite the absence of formal Apartheid. Both countries grapple with the legacy of racial divisions. 
    In Kenya's case, colonial rule and lingering tribal tensions can create social barriers. 
    An example seen is the culture of 'Kikuyu' and 'Luo',this two communities have been on crossroads since we got independence
    This started with the forefathers and has been carried through all along the generations. 
    While Apartheid was a systematized racial hierarchy, social prejudices can persist.
    
    Noah's experience as a mixed-race child navigating racial ambiguity mirrors situations in Kenya. 
    Just as his presence defied racial classifications in South Africa, children born from different Kenyan ethnicities can bridge cultural divides.
    This can be seen especially in the traditional setting famililies where the parents can not fathom the children getting married or marrying out of the tribe
    
    
     Their experiences often challenge societal norms and push for a more inclusive future.
    
    "Born a Crime" transcends borders by highlighting the fight for a society that celebrates diversity. 
     Although the specifics of racial challenges may differ between South Africa and Kenya, the underlying quest for social harmony remains a universal pursuit.
